# Leetify notifier

This project monitors your and your friends' Leetify profiles to notify via Telegram when a match has been imported.

It also watches for new highlights.

This project may not be following the best practices due to being a quick project for a small group of friends and was made as a way to better understand Go. If you have any suggestions or optmizations, I would appreciate if you could please open an Issue or submit a Pull Request.
